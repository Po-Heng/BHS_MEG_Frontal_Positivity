## A short description of the project

Prior EEG studies have shown both unexpected meanings and less frequent meanings of ambiguous words would enhance a frontal positivity, which may indicate a general mechanism for reprioritizing weaker meanings. Due to bad spatial resolution, EEG can’t tell us which area(s) in human brain are responsible for or related to the process indexed by the frontal positivity effect. In the present project, I plan to take advantage of MEG, which has good temporal and spatial resolution at the same time, to investigate the neural substrates of meaning reprioritization.

## Data and tools to use
- A dataset we’ve collected with 26 young participants 
- MNE-Python software
